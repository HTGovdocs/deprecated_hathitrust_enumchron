== Duplicate detection process

* Start with the full hathifile
* throw out everything without an enumchron
* throw out 21_229 items whose enumchron looks like it's just a copy number
* End up with 5_082_842 items that have an enumchron we're interested in
* Consider two items to be "related" if they share any OCLC, ISBN, ISSN, LCCN, or "source instituion record" (sir)
* Items that have at least one of the following: {oclc"=>4439767, "lccn"=>2675446, "issn"=>1478003, "isbn"=>289394, "sir"=>5082454}
* Recursively (i.e., transitively) merge those relations to make "clusters"
* Ignore the 320_309 clusters with exactly one item in them
* Do analysis on the 499_864 clusters with multiple items
